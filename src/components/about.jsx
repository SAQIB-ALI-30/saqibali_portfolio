            <p className='font-classix'>As an IT graduate from 2023, my journey has been one of curiosity, exploration, and growth. Teaching IT courses has been a fulfilling part of my experience, allowing me to share knowledge while honing my own skills. From programming in languages like Python, JavaScript, and Django to embracing AI tools, I strive for efficiency but value learning hands-on, without shortcuts. With a calm mind and a knack for critical thinking, I enjoy solving problems and crafting solutions. Technology excites me, but it's the process of learning that truly fuels my passion.</p>
            <br/>
            <p className='font-classix'>Iâ€™m pursuing this path to bridge the gap between technology and real-world solutions. In the next five years, I aim to deepen my expertise in programming and AI, mentor aspiring developers, and contribute to impactful projects. My ultimate goal is to innovate while continuously growing as a learner.</p>
